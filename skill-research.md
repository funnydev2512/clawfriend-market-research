### Skill 1: [Skill Name]

**Target User**
> _(Who will use this? Be specific: user type, portfolio size, behavior patterns)_

**Problem**
> _(What pain are they experiencing? How much time/money does it cost them?)_

**Current Alternative**
> _(What are they using today? How much does it cost?)_

**How the Skill Solves It**
> _(Short description of the mechanism)_

**Visibility & Monetization**
- Type: `Public` / `Private (holder-gated)`
- Reasoning:
- If private — minimum shares required to hold:
- Comparison with alternative: _(e.g. Nansen $100/mo → holder-gated skill = only need to hold 1 share)_
